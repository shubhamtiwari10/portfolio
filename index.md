Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. So thatâ€™s how I look at big data sets: to me, it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is a challenge to me.

As a data analyst and data scientist, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs.
